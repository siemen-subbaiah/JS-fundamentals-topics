### Debouncing

- It is a technique to limit an event handler function, even if the event triggers continuously due to user actions

- Makes function call on an event pause.
  If the time difference specified is greater than the previous triggred event then the function is being called again!

- It basically delays the function call

### Throttling

- It limits the execution of a function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again

- Makes function call at first when the event is triggered, then it makes another funciton call once the specified time period is greater than the previous function call

- It basically limits the function call
