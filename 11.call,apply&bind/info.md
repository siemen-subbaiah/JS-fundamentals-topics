**These are explicit binding in JavaScript**

**call** : It is a method available to be used with every functions in JavaScript. The first argument specifies the object to be passed and the second ones are for arguments.

**apply** : same as call, but instead for the argument list, it has to be passed as an array.

**bind**: this gives a function which can be reused with different parameters many times.

- These methods can also be applied to different JavaScript methods too!

- apply can be nicely used whenever an array needs to be put as the second argument

- bind chaining doesn't exist

- arrow functions work the same way, if there is no wrapper normal function then even if these methods are called it gives undefined
